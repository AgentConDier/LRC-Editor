# LRC Editor 
![Version: 2.4.1](https://d25lcipzij17d.cloudfront.net/badge.svg?id=gh&type=6&v=2.4.1)

### Fork by AgentConDier [discontinued]
This is used to be an in-progress rewrite of my previous fork, aiming to recreate the features I added while incorporating recent changes by Spikatrix. See [the progress tracking issue](https://github.com/AgentConDier/LRC-Editor/issues/3)

Since the latest update added a recursive file list and included a lot of other fixes, I decided to create a python script to keep track of associating music- and lrc files instead of having to modify the app everytime it updates. I still created the branch [music-autoload](https://github.com/AgentConDier/LRC-Editor/tree/music-autoload) to add functionality for automatically loading a song when opening the editor.
